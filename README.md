**npm**: `npm i playerx`  
**cdn**: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/playerx  

## Features

- **Uniform player API** across player platforms. Mimics the `HTMLMediaElement` API when possible.
- **UI framework independent**, intentionally uses no specific framework to have great interop across the board and keep the bundle size in check.
